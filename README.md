# Traffic_Signs_Detection


Last week, I follow the instructions of https://github.com/alexstaravoitau/traffic-signs/tree/master to implement the deep learning network to detect the traffic signs. Compare with his work, I divided the code into different files, which would make the code structure be more clear. Also, I deleted some data propagation parts, such as rotating. And, I simplyfy the logging process to make the code more achievable. 

About the data part, I cannot attach it here cause it is too large. If you want you can email me.
